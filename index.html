  <h1>Thoughts on life right now</h1>
  <p>Getting an education is interesting but the game is harder now that professors think that
    they can abuse students because they have tenure fuck teacher, fuck their families, fuck their houses, fuck their properties,
    fuck their religion, fuck their syllabus, fuck their hobbies, fuck their lack of extra credit.</p>
  <h1>Hobbies</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Watching Anime</li>
    <li>Playing Dark Souls 2</li>
    <li>Eating New Foods</li>
